# Business Loan Risk Predictor

Author: Morris M. F. Chan

Inspired by the journal article [“Should This Loan be Approved or Denied?”: A Large Dataset with Class Assignment Guidelines](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2018.1434342), this project aims to study factors affecting risks of loans being charged-off. We are currently using machine learning algorithms to study the associations of interest. We are currently using a public data set by U.S. Small Business Administration. The data set can be found [here](https://data.sba.gov/en/dataset/7-a-504-foia).

## Methodology

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is done by visually inspecting the associations between each variable and the status loans. The full EDA report can be found [here](https://github.com/morrismanfung/business-loan-risk/blob/main/docs/01-eda.ipynb).
